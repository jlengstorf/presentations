# Open Source Everything

The vast majority of companies should open source all of their code, because the code itself isn’t their competitive advantage.

-   People still treat code — even UI code — as a proprietary secret
-   It's not
-   It's actually the best demo of using your service that exists
-   A UI should be a stateless presentation layer that calls into your back-end via API endpoints; OPEN SOURCE THAT SHIT TO SHOW PEOPLE HOW TO USE YOUR API
