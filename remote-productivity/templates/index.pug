      I woke up checking email. I worked through all of my meals. I ordered in

      friends, and when I did, I’d often end up ducking out to take a phone call

      unexplained loss of whiskers in beards. There’s no proven cause, but some

  +slide
    h4 Strategy #1:
    h2 #[em Track] Your Time

      The simple act of #[em acknowledging] how we spend our time encourages us
      to use it more wisely.

  +slide
    h3 If I have a #[strong long] day...

      src="images/work-life-balance/rescuetime-day-off.png"
      alt="a day off in RescueTime"
    )

  +slide
    h4 Strategy #2:
    h2 #[em Time-Box] Tasks
    p.
      You’re never more productive than when you’re up against a deadline with 
      13% battery left.
  
  +slide
    h3 Find your rhythm.
    ul
      li.fragment Decide how long you want to focus for
      li.fragment Close and turn off #[em everything] unrelated
      li.fragment Start a timer
      li.fragment Unleash your brilliance upon the world
      li.fragment When the timer goes off, take a break
      li.fragment Repeat
    
    aside.notes.
      Experiment with different periods of time to figure out what’s best for 
      your attention span and comfort. I find that 90 minutes works well, but my
      partner does best with 60-minute blocks. Others swear by the 25-minute 
      Pomodoro method — everyone will have their own ideal focus period.
      #[br]#[br]
      After you’ve experimented with this for a while, you’ll likely notice that
      you’ve finished your todo list in six hours or less.

  +slide
    h2 Why This Works

  +slide
    h3 1. We’re #[em not distracted]
    
    aside.notes.
       Interruptions are expensive — writing code requires creating complex
       mental models, and if we’re interrupted or distracted, we lose a lot of
       time rebuilding them to remember what we were trying to accomplish.

  +slide
    h3 2. We get into a #[em flow state]
    
    aside.notes.
       Without interruptions, we can get into what Mihaly Cziksentmihalyi calls
       a “flow state” — being “in the zone” — which is where we’re deeply
       engaged in the task at hand. This is where our best (and most satisfying)
       work happens.

  +slide
    h3 3. We’re #[em taking breaks]
    
    aside.notes.
       However, if we‘re working in a flow state and not taking regular breaks,
       we hit what I like to call the “code zombie” state: after a few hours, we
       hit the wall and get into that foggy, not-quite-human state where we
       can’t really do useful work anymore, but we’re also too mentally fried to
       go out and interact with other humans. (Marisa calls this “forgetting how
       to be a person”.)

  +slide
    h3 4. We’re #[em still available]
    
    aside.notes.
       Another critical point here is that by time-boxing, we’re not sacrificing
       availability for focus. We can check in on our colleagues, clients, and
       other communication channels every 90 minutes or so, allowing us to stay
       available without multitasking or waiting until the middle of the night
       to get “real work” done.

  +slide
    h2 Also: #[em science]#[sup *]
    p.
      We all have something called an “ultradian rhythm”, which regulates our 
      energy in 90-minute-ish intervals.#[sup 8]
    p.fragment
      small #[sup *] May not be #[em actual] science.

  +slide
    h4 Strategy #3:
    h2 #[em Front-Load] Important Work
    p.
      Motivation and self-control are resources that deplete as the day goes on.
      Don’t waste them.

  +slide
    h3 We’re the #[em best] versions of ourselves early in our day
    ul
      li.fragment energy is higher
      li.fragment focus is improved
      li.fragment self-control is at its peak

      This is NOT me saying you should wake up early. Wake up whenever you want;

    aside.notes.
      At IBM, we spent months working on a new feature. Toward the end of the
      project, we realized that the original goal of the feature wasn’t possible
      with the approach we’d taken — but management decided to ship it anyways
      “because we committed to deliver this”. So we effectively made our product
      worse because we were focused on output instead of outcome.
