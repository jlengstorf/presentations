            have two options to get us across the finish line: 1) we can figure out

            rockstar developer every recruiter dreams of and single-handedly solve

            It feels great to be the hero: you pull off a miracle and finish the
            project on time; your team is relieved and grateful; your manager is
            happy; it typically leads to public praise and potentially promotions,

            Digging into the underlying causes of team inefficiencies isn’t typically
            considered a good time. It’s hard to communicate the business value of it,
            and typically management will push back if you try to focus on underlying
            problems instead of putting out immediate fires. There are not usually
            rewards, recognition, or even gratitude for pursuing this option. This is
            not glamorous or high-profile work.

          <aside class="notes">
            It’s common to hear developers talk about the “bus factor” — also called
            the “truck number” or “lottery number” — of a given codebase. It’s 
            intended to point out the fragility of a project: how many people have to
            get hit by a bus before no one is left that knows how it works?
            <br><br>
            That feels a little too negative and alarmist to me, though. So what about
            a more positive (and realistic) term for it?

          <aside class="notes">
            On any team, we need everyone to have the ability to take time off. So
            instead of talking about the bus factor, talk about how easily any given
            person can go on vacation. Could two people go on vacation without
            stalling the rest of the team? Ideally, every team member should be pretty
            effective even if the entire team took time off.

            If the rockstar is carrying most of the weight for a team, that means
            that work bottlenecks around the rockstar. Typically, teams start to
            automatically defer to the rockstar, which means there are fewer people
            taking initiative; instead, they respond to pretty much everything with,
            “You’d have to check with _________.” And because of that dependency, team
            members allow the rockstar to become the team’s source of truth — that’s a
            huge problem, because when the rockstar eventually burns out and quits (or
            retires, or gets transferred or promoted), all of that knowledge goes
            with them.

            When teams run poorly, in my experience that largely comes from people
            either lacking confidence — they’re not confident they know how to do the
            thing, they’re not confident they’re allowed to do the thing without
            sign-off, they’re not confident that someone else on the team won’t go in
            and rewrite their code later — or lacking clarity: they’re not clear on
            what’s expected of them; they’re not clear on who the stakeholders are;
            they’re not clear on what “done” looks like.

          <aside class="notes">
            When a team feels confident, they can act without feeling like they need
            to seek approval — and that’s a good thing, because the parameters for
            what someone can do without approval are clearly defined in the process.
            Since the goals and accountability chains are crystal clear, no one needs
            to wonder where to start or what to work on next. This leads to a team of
            people who trust each other because the proper guard rails are in place.
            And because there’s trust, team members feel real ownership in the
            projects and process: they have a voice, and that voice is being heard.
            And because the process defines what is and isn’t acceptable, the whole
            team can feel safe to bring up potential issues. Usually, though, a good
            process means the issues get caught <em>way</em> earlier, before they become
            huge problems. All of this leads to the kind of high-collaboration,
            high-functioning environment every management consultant dreams about.

            A high-functioning team’s process will be so solid that new team members

            enough to have them commit non-trivial code to production on the first
            day. The team should be documenting any repeatable process so it can be
            quickly referenced by everyone else. This gets driven home by solid
            coaching, and the best practices are enforced by comprehensive test suites
            and a set of guidelines for code style and quality.

            get comfortable and forget, and ultimately the team’s best practices

            Chip and Dan Heath have written extensively about behavioral change, and a
            concept they use frequently is “the elephant and the rider”. We’re all
            pretty rational and capable of thinking through long-term benefits —
            that’s the rider. But there’s this other set of urges that frequently
            overpower our rationality in favor of instant gratification — that’s
            the elephant.

            One of the most rewarding things is to make people more efficient — it
            feels really good to do great work ahead of schedule, so we should try to
            make sure that every process we introduce feels like an upgrade. Some
            processes require extra work, though, so we should make sure to frequently
            and immediately praise great work from the team. When someone follows the
            process, reinforce that behavior by thanking them personally. Remember, it
            never sucks to hear you’re doing a good job, and usually we have to live
            with “no news is good news”; offer positive feedback early and often. When
            there’s a team meeting or a company all-hands, recognize the team publicly
            for doing good work. It’s a small effort, but it goes a long way.

            did a good job when you see good work <em>never</em> hurts; <em>not</em> telling
            someone they did a good job can potentially lead to them feeling like
            they’re doing poorly. [Tell Marisa and Mike story.]

            Automation is a great way to hit that efficiency emotional reward. Take
            something that sucks (like deploying and testing changes) and automate it.
            Once the automation is in place, it’s relatively easy to extend the
            automation to do more things, like automatically fix style issues, check
            for known anti-patterns with ESLint, check for internal issues using
            something like Danger.js, enforce code coverage standards, or even
            automatically deploy new versions of your app.

            A surefire way to undermine any automated process is to make it nitpicky.
            Don’t fail a PR on something like missing semicolons or formatting; just
            run Prettier and autocommit the result to the PR. If team members have to
            jump through annoying hoops to appease the automations, they WILL find a
            way to work around them (like prettierignore).

            Earlier, I talked about how it’s not glamorous to be the team’s auditor.
            Most of that comes from the fact that it sucks to have to follow people
            around and hassle them about things like code style, test coverage, and
            other things that we all know we should be doing, but often get lazy
            about. Being the team’s code cop starts to feel a lot like being a parent
            nagging your kids to clean their rooms.

            process — no one’s code gets preferential treatment, and the rules are
            exactly the same for everyone, regardless of experience or title. Plus, no
            one needs to be the auditor; the things the team decides are important get
            checked consistently and automatically every single time someone opens a
            PR. This practice alone will avoid mountains of technical debt.

            It can be tempting to build a project in, say, React, and then start

            tools adds extra complexity and cognitive overhead for the team. Don’t add
            a tool until you’ve got a real reason. If you definitely need a tool, look
            for a well-documented, stable, open source tool first; building stuff
            in-house means someone internal is on the hook to document, maintain, and
            support it, and that’s rarely a sustainable option for utilities. And
            don’t try to predict the future; code is a relatively short-lived product,
            so trying to build something “future-proof” is a bit of a fool’s errand.
            Code with deletion and replacement in mind, not infinite flexibility
            and scalability.

            In the spirit of trade-offs, “future-proofing” an app is making a

            extra complexity now that may never actually be useful. But we also
            shouldn’t completely ignore the future when designing our projects — our

            productive now without ending up with tomorrow’s legacy nightmare. One way
            to do this is to emphasize writing easy-to-delete code: few dependencies,

            Probably the most important point, in my humble opinion, is to limit your

            to do <em>before</em> we can do our actual work. This means investing in our

            the need to do a ton of work just so they can start working.

          <aside class="notes">
            Yak shaving means all the work you have to do before you can start
            actually working. For example, if you need to mow the lawn, but you
            realize the lawn mower is out of gas, then discover that your gas can has
            a hole in it, you now have to go to the hardware store, then the gas
            station, all before you can even <em>begin</em> doing the original task.
            I can’t stress enough how important it is to invest in your team’s
            technical foundation. [Straw poll: how many of you lose at least an hour a
            week to fighting your dev environment (e.g. build tools, local envs,
            containers, deployment)?] [Tell IBM NGINX story.]

            If anyone tries to argue that working on the foundation doesn’t have
            anything to do with business needs, show them this math. Assuming a dev
            team of 20 people and using Glassdoor info for a salary baseline, just
            <em>two hours a week</em> of time spent on yak shaving costs $75,000 dollars.
            That’s an entire additional salary wasted on tasks that aren’t actually
            related to the company’s goals.

            Another reason to focus on the foundation is that we can enforce cultural
