      Digging into the underlying causes of team inefficiencies isn’t typically
      considered a good time. It’s hard to communicate the business value of it,
      and typically management will push back if you try to focus on underlying
      problems instead of putting out immediate fires. There are not usually
      rewards, recognition, or even gratitude for pursuing this option. This is
      not glamorous or high-profile work.

    aside.notes.
      It’s common to hear developers talk about the “bus factor” — also called the “truck number” or “lottery number” — of a given codebase. It’s intended to point out the fragility of a project: how many people have to get hit by a bus before no one is left that knows how it works?
      #[br]#[br]
      That feels a little too negative and alarmist to me, though. So what about a more positive (and realistic) term for it?

    aside.notes.
      On any team, we need everyone to have the ability to take time off. So instead of talking about the bus factor, talk about how easily any given person can go on vacation. Could two people go on vacation without stalling the rest of the team? Ideally, every team member should be pretty effective even if the entire team took time off.

    aside.notes.
      If the rockstar is carrying most of the weight for a team, that means that work bottlenecks around the rockstar. Typically, teams start to automatically defer to the rockstar, which means there are fewer people taking initiative; instead, they respond to pretty much everything with, “You’d have to check with _________.” And because of that dependency, team members allow the rockstar to become the team’s source of truth — that’s a huge problem, because when the rockstar eventually burns out and quits (or retires, or gets transferred or promoted), all of that knowledge goes with them.

    aside.notes.
      When teams run poorly, in my experience that largely comes from people either lacking confidence — they’re not confident they know how to do the thing, they’re not confident they’re allowed to do the thing without sign-off, they’re not confident that someone else on the team won’t go in and rewrite their code later — or lacking clarity: they’re not clear on what’s expected of them; they’re not clear on who the stakeholders are; they’re not clear on what “done” looks like.

    aside.notes.
      When a team feels confident, they can act without feeling like they need to seek approval — and that’s a good thing, because the parameters for what someone can do without approval are clearly defined in the process. Since the goals and accountability chains are crystal clear, no one needs to wonder where to start or what to work on next. This leads to a team of people who trust each other because the proper guard rails are in place. And because there’s trust, team members feel real ownership in the projects and process: they have a voice, and that voice is being heard. And because the process defines what is and isn’t acceptable, the whole team can feel safe to bring up potential issues. Usually, though, a good process means the issues get caught #[em way] earlier, before they become huge problems. All of this leads to the kind of high-collaboration, high-functioning environment every management consultant dreams about.

    aside.notes.
      A high-functioning team’s process will be so solid that new team members are basically painting by numbers to get started. A good measuring stick for this is whether or not you can get a new hire up and running fast enough to have them commit non-trivial code to production on the first day. The team should be documenting any repeatable process so it can be quickly referenced by everyone else. This gets driven home by solid coaching, and the best practices are enforced by comprehensive test suites and a set of guidelines for code style and quality.

      Chip and Dan Heath have written extensively about behavioral change, and a concept they use frequently is “the elephant and the rider”. We’re all pretty rational and capable of thinking through long-term benefits — that’s the rider. But there’s this other set of urges that frequently overpower our rationality in favor of instant gratification — that’s the elephant.

      Being right isn’t enough. If we could solve human problems with logic, there wouldn’t be any problems.

This means that we need to make any new processes more emotionally rewarding than the old way of doing things.

    aside.notes.
      One of the most rewarding things is to make people more efficient — it feels really good to do great work ahead of schedule, so we should try to make sure that every process we introduce feels like an upgrade. Some processes require extra work, though, so we should make sure to frequently and immediately praise great work from the team. When someone follows the process, reinforce that behavior by thanking them personally. Remember, it never sucks to hear you’re doing a good job, and usually we have to live with “no news is good news”; offer positive feedback early and often. When there’s a team meeting or a company all-hands, recognize the team publicly for doing good work. It’s a small effort, but it goes a long way.

      We often don’t give people praise because it feels weird to compliment people.

      Automation is a great way to hit that efficiency emotional reward. Take something that sucks (like deploying and testing changes) and automate it. Once the automation is in place, it’s relatively easy to extend the automation to do more things, like automatically fix style issues, check for known anti-patterns with ESLint, check for internal issues using something like Danger.js, enforce code coverage standards, or even automatically deploy new versions of your app.

      A surefire way to undermine any automated process is to make it nitpicky.

If team members have to jump through annoying hoops to appease the automations, they WILL find a way to work around them (like prettierignore).

      Earlier, I talked about how it’s not glamorous to be the team’s auditor. Most of that comes from the fact that it sucks to have to follow people around and hassle them about things like code style, test coverage, and other things that we all know we should be doing, but often get lazy about. Being the team’s code cop starts to feel a lot like being a parent nagging your kids to clean their rooms.

      However, if we can get a robot in there to do the nagging, it gets a lot easier. There’s nothing emotional or judgmental about an automated process — no one’s code gets preferential treatment, and the rules are exactly the same for everyone, regardless of experience or title. Plus, no one needs to be the auditor; the things the team decides are important get checked consistently and automatically every single time someone opens a PR. This practice alone will avoid mountains of technical debt.

      It can be tempting to build a project in, say, React, and then start adding tools: Redux, Thunk, Sagas, Recompose, and so on. But each of those tools adds extra complexity and cognitive overhead for the team. Don’t add a tool until you’ve got a real reason. If you definitely need a tool, look for a well-documented, stable, open source tool first; building stuff in-house means someone internal is on the hook to document, maintain, and support it, and that’s rarely a sustainable option for utilities. And don’t try to predict the future; code is a relatively short-lived product, so trying to build something “future-proof” is a bit of a fool’s errand. Code with deletion and replacement in mind, not infinite flexibility and scalability.

      Everything we do in our codebase has trade-offs. Jem recommends basing each decision on what will make the team most productive, even if that means skipping a tool that might logically be “more correct” because it’s too complicated to easily train the rest of the team.

      In the spirit of trade-offs, “future-proofing” an app is making a trade-off. Adding a ton of “maybe we’ll need this someday” options is extra complexity now that may never actually be useful. But we also shouldn’t completely ignore the future when designing our projects — our job as lead developers is to find the right balance of keeping people productive now without ending up with tomorrow’s legacy nightmare. One way to do this is to emphasize writing easy-to-delete code: few dependencies, small size, and no side-effects.

And if my experience is any indicator, it’s probably safe to say that the average dev is losing #[em way more] than one hour each week to non-core work.

      Another reason to focus on the foundation is that we can enforce cultural norms through our boilerplates. If we provide a boilerplate with all the best practices baked into it, we’re changing the psychology of how our team interacts with our codebase. Instead of handing our team a blank slate (or worse, a pile of spaghetti code) and then asking them to fix it so it follows our team standards...

      span.underlined(style="display: block; font-size: 187%; line-height: 0.9") succeed
    
    aside.notes.
      ...we should work to hand them well-built, thoroughly tested starters and boilerplates that already meet our standards. That way, all they have to do is keep it healthy and worry about #[em new] code. This appeals to our subconscious desire to keep nice things nice, and it helps steer the elephant in the direction of doing things The Right Way. We’re giving them the best possible chance of doing something awesome, demonstrated on this slide by these gentlemen playing sportsball.
