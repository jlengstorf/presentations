# GraphQL: Killer Speed, Quality Code, Better UX, and Simpler Development Workflow ðŸ”¥

GraphQL is a better data layer. It consumes data from multiple data sources â€” REST APIs, databases, text files, and more â€” and creates a single endpoint with a simple, JSON-like syntax for retrieving just the data you need to build the UI.

Companies including Facebook (where GraphQL originated), Twitter, Airbnb, and more are moving to GraphQL. In this talk weâ€™ll take a look at some of the reasons why, and how we can get those same benefits in our own projects.

## Outline

* What currently sucks?
    * Data
        * Finding docs about data (show 404 page)
        * Having to bother other teams for data
        * Waiting for data to be available (API is down)
        * Getting data (REST fetch example)
    * Loading spinners
    * Long load times
    * Managing app state
* What if it didnâ€™t suck anymore?
    * Have a single place where all data is explorable, testable, and documented
    * Create autonomy to allow teams to work in parallel
    * Eliminate external dependencies during development
    * Describe data declaratively and it just... arrives
    * Show an explorable UI even when no data has been loaded
    * Make the
* How can we get to that magical place?
    *
* Recap.
