# Keynotes, Conference Talks, Workshops, and Other Presentations by Jason Lengstorf

I have too many repos that aren't actually useful on their own because they're disjointed presentations, demos, and other nonsense. The goal of this repo is to create a single location where presentations live, including relevant demos, slide decks, and other resources.

## What’s In This Repo?

-   [Workshop slides and details](#workshops)
-   [Technical session slides, details, and videos (when available)](#talks)
